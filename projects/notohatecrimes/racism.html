					<h2>What is racism?</h2>
					Racism is actions, practices or beliefs, or social or political systems that
					consider different races to be ranked as inherently superior or inferior to 
					each other, based on presumed shared inheritable traits, abilities, or qualities. 
					It may also hold that members of different races should be treated differently. 
					While most conceptualizations of racism include the notion of "race based discrimination", 
					the exact definition is controversial both because there is little scholarly agreement about 
					the meaning of the concept "race", and because there is also little agreement about what does and 
					does not constitute discrimination.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Some definitions consider that any assumption that a person's behavior would be influenced by their racial 
					categorization is inherently racist, regardless of whether the action is intentionally harmful or pejorative,
					because stereotyping necessarily subordinates individual identity to group identity. In sociology and psychology, 
					a common view distinguishes prejudice from racism, holding that racism is best understood as 'prejudice plus power' 
					because without the support of political or economic power, prejudice would not be able to manifest as a pervasive cultural, 
					institutional or social phenomenon. Other definitions only include consciously malignant forms of discrimination. 
					Among the questions about how to define racism are the question of whether to include forms of discrimination that are unintentional, 
					such as making assumptions about preferences or abilities of others based on racial stereotypes, whether to include symbolic orinstitutionalized 
					forms of discrimination such as the circulation of ethnic stereotypes through the media, and whether to include the socio-political dynamics of 
					social stratification that sometimes have a racial component. Some definitions of racism also include discriminatory behaviors and beliefs based on 
					cultural, national, ethnic, caste, or religious stereotypes. Some critics of the term argue that the term is applied differentially, with a focus on 
					such prejudices by whites, and in ways that define mere observations of any possible differences between races as racism.
				<p>

					<h2>Racism and racial discrimination</h2>
					Racism and racial discrimination are often used to describe discrimination on an ethnic or cultural basis, 
					independent of whether these differences are described as racial. According to the United Nations convention, 
					there is no distinction between the terms racial discrimination and ethnic discrimination,and superiority based 
					on racial differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous, and that 
					there is no justification for racial discrimination, in theory or in practice, anywhere.
				<p>
				
				<p>
					In Canada, there are strong human rights laws and systems to address discrimination. At the same time, 
					we also have a legacy of racism - particularly towards Aboriginal persons, but to other groups as well, 
					including African, Chinese, Japanese, South Asian, Jewish and Muslim Canadians. This legacy affects our systems 
					and structures even today, affecting the lives of racialized persons and all people in Canada.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Racism is a broader experience and practice than racial discrimination. Racism is a belief that one group is superior to others. 
					Racism can be openly displayed in racial jokes, slurs or hate crimes. It can also be more deeply rooted in attitudes, values and 
					stereotypical beliefs. In some cases, people don’t even realize they have these beliefs. Instead, they are assumptions that have evolved 
					over time and have become part of systems and institutions, and also associated with the dominant group’s power and privilege.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Racial harassment is a form of discrimination. It includes comments, jokes, name-calling, display of pictures or behaviour that insults you,
					offends you or puts you down because of your race and other related grounds.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Racial discrimination can often be very subtle, such as being assigned to less desirable jobs, or being denied mentoring and training. 
					It might also mean facing different job standards than other workers, being denied an apartment because you appear to have Aboriginal ancestry,
					or facing unfair scrutiny from police while driving or from security staff at a shopping mall.
