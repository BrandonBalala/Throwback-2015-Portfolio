				<h1>Welcome to the Say No To Hate Crime website</h1>

				<p>
				Hate crimes and incidents come in many different forms. It can be because of hatred on the grounds of your race and religion as well as sexual
				orientation, transgender identity or disability.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<h3>Here are the hate crimes that this site talks about:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Bullying</li>
						<li>Racism</li>
						<li>Sexism</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Hate crime in any form is wrong. This is why it is important that if a hate crime happens to you or someone you know, you report it. Reporting
				makes a difference to you, your friends, and your community. By reporting hate crime when it happens, you can help stop it happening to someone
				else. You will also help the police to better understand the level of hate crime in your local area, and improve the way they respond to it.
