		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
		Fire ant is the common name for several species of ants in the genus Solenopsis.
		They are however only a minority in the genus, which includes over 285 species
		of Solenopsis worldwide. Solenopsis are stinging ants and most of their common
		names reflect this, for example, ginger ants and tropical fire ants. Many species
		also are called red ants because of their light brown colour, though species of ants
		in many other genera are similarly named for similar reasons.
		Examples include Myrmica rubra and Pogonomyrmex barbatus.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		None of these names applies in all countries nor to all species of Solenopsis, nor
		only to Solenopsis species; for example the colloquial names for several species 
		of weaver ants in the genus Oecophylla in Southeast Asia include "fire ants" 
		because of their red color and painful sting; the two genera however are not even 
		closely related.
		</p>

		<a name="Appearance"></a>
		<h2>Appearance</h2>
		<p>
		The bodies of mature fire ants, like the bodies of all typical mature insects,
		are divided into three sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen, with three
		pairs of legs and a pair of antennae. Fire ants of those species invasive in
		the United States can be distinguished from other ants locally present, by their copper
		brown head and body with a darker abdomen. The worker ants are blackish to reddish,
		and their size varies from 2 mm to 6 mm (0.12 in to 0.24 in). In an established nest
		these different sizes of ants all are present at the same time.
		</p>

		<a name="Behavior"></a>
		<h2>Behavior</h2>
		<p>
		A typical fire ant colony produces large mounds in open areas,
		and feeds mostly on young plants,seeds and sometimes crickets.
		Fire ants often attack small animals and can kill them.
		Unlike many other ants, which bite and then spray
		acid on the wound, fire ants bite only to get a grip and
		then sting (from the abdomen) and inject a toxic alkaloid venom
		called Solenopsin, a compound from the class of piperidines.
		For humans, this is a painful sting, a sensation similar to
		what one feels when burned by fire—hence the name fire ant—and
		the after effects of the sting can be deadly to sensitive people.
		The liquid is both insecticidal and antibiotic.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Solenopsis spp. ants can be identified by three body features—a pedicel with two 
		nodes, an unarmed propodeum, and antennae with 10 segments plus a two-segmented 
		club.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Many ants bite, and formicine ants can cause irritation by spraying formic acid; 
		myrmecine ants like fire ants have a dedicated venom-injecting sting, which injects
		an alkaloid venom, as well as mandibles for biting.

		<h2>Roles</h2>
			<dl>
				<dt><h3>Queen</h3></dt>
				<dd>Fire ant queens, the reproductive females in their colony, also are generally 
				the largest. Their primary function is reproduction; fire ant queens may live as 
				many as 6 to 7 years and can produce up to 3,500 eggs per day. That adds up to 
				roughly 9 million eggs produced during a single queen's lifetime. Young, virgin 
				fire ant queens have wings (as do male fire ants), but rip them off after mating.
				</dd>
				<dt><h3>Males (drones)</h3></dt>
				<dd>Males mate with the queen. They die immediately after mating. There are other
				types of roles in an ant colony like the workers and the soldier ants. The soldier 
				ants are known for their larger and more powerful mandibles while the worker takes 
				care of regular tasks (the main tasks in a colony are caring for the eggs/larvae/pupae, 
				cleaning the nest, and foraging for food).
				</dd>
