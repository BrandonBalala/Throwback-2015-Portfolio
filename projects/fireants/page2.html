		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
		Classical or self-sustaining biological control is the use of imported natural 
		enemies to suppress pests. Self-sustaining biological control can be an effective
		and environmentally safe method to permanently control pests over wide areas.  As 
		such, it is the basis for many integrated pest management (IPM) programs.In South 
		America, the native habitat for imported fire ants (red, black, and hybrid), 
		populations are much lower than populations in the southern United States and other areas 
		where imported fire ants have been accidentally introduced (see International page).
		This situation is thought to arise because natural enemies (predators, parasites 
		and pathogens) that keep populations low in South America were not imported along 
		with this ant. Efforts have been made to introduce natural enemies to the invasive 
		ant populations in order to provide sustainable suppression.

		<a name="Parasites"></a>
		<h2>Parasites</h2>
		<p>
		The term phorid fly is used for any of the flies belonging to the family Phoridae.
		There are about 230 genera in the family Phoridae.  At least 3,000 species have 
		been described, although there are many more undescribed species.  Certain species 
		of flies belonging to the genus Pseudacteon are known to attack fire ants (Solenopsis
		spp.).  Pseudacteon species that attack fire ants in South America have been introduced
		into areas where Solenopsis invicta and Solenopsis richteri are invasive pests. 
		Watch video of Pseudacteon phorid fly attacking a major imported fire ant worker 
		(video by A. A. Calixto).
		</p>

		<a name="Pathogens"></a>
		<h2>Pathogens</h2>
		<p>
		The microsporidian pathogen Kneallhazia (=Thelohania) solenopsae infects the red 
		imported fire ant, Solenopsis.invicta, and the black imported fire ant, Solenopsis 
		richteri (Sokolova and Fuxa 2008). In Argentina, about 13 percent of fire ant 
		colonies have been found to be infected (Briano et al.2006). Surveys in the U.S. 
		did not detect this disease organism until 1996, when it was discovered in Florida.
		Since then, K. solenopsae has also been found and/or released in most fire ant 
		infested southeastern United States (Knutson & Drees 1998, Milks et al. 2008).
		</p>
		
		<p>
		This microscopic pathogen infects immature and adult fire ants. Diseased ants, 
		including queens, have shorter life spans. Infected queens become weaker and stop 
		laying eggs. Over a period of several months to a year, the diseased colony declines
		(Williams et al. 1999). Infections of S. invicta have resulted in smaller colony 
		sizes and population reductions of 63% in the U.S.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Many ants bite, and formicine ants can cause irritation by spraying formic acid; 
		myrmecine ants like fire ants have a dedicated venom-injecting sting, which injects
		an alkaloid venom, as well as mandibles for biting.
		</p>

		<a name="Competitors"></a>
		<h2>Competitors</h2>
		<p>
		No open niches. In the world of ants, no ecological niche goes unexploited. As a 
		group, the ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are found in almost every habitat. If 
		resources in a habitat become available, one or more ant species soon will exploit 
		them and will colonize the habitat. Imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta, S. 
		richteri and their sexually reproductive hybrid) are very efficient colonizers of 
		disturbed or open habitats within their introduce range (See geographic distribution
		of imported fire ants in the U.S.). This is accomplished through frequent mating 
		flights throughout the year whenever proper conditions occur, colony ground migration
		and direct and/or indirect competition with other native and exotic ant species.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Direct competition. The very large imported fire ant colonies contain hundreds of 
		thousands of worker ants that can dominate newly invaded areas by out-competing 
		other ant species (nesting and foraging on the surface in the same area). However,
		interactions between imported fire ants and other ant species can vary dramatically
		depending on the conditions and the resources available in space and time for a part
		icular area. Only a few other ant species can win battles in direct competition. 
		Imported fire ants have displaced, decimated or eliminated native Solenopsis fire 
		ant species throughout much of the southern U.S. See video of S. invicta fighting 
		S. geminata, a native fire ant species. In this video, S. geminata has the lighter 
		brown body coloration and the major worker has a squarish head. Fire ants fight 
		using their jaws or mandibles to bite and the stinger to inject venom into the 
		body of other competitors to immobilize them.

		<a name="Predators"></a>	
		<h2>Predators</h2>
		<p>
		Armadillos, antlions, spiders, birds, and horned lizards have been known to eat 
		fire ants when given the opportunity, but are not known to have a major impact on 
		imported fire ant populations.
